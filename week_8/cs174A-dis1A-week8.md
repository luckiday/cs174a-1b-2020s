# Texture Mapping

- There are small surface details on real objects that need to be taken into account for better realism.

- To take these into account apply texture to our images to make the surfaces realistic 

  - We can scan textures from real world or paint them

  - Store the texture as a 2D image

  - We map the texture to **object space** and then **screen space**

- A practical approach is to do the screen to texture transformation (so that we donâ€™t have to deal with pixel coverage issues)

- Some texture to object transformations

  - Square to cylinder

  - From screen to texture:

    - Inverse the transform $(s_x,s_y)$ to get the world $(x,y,z)$
    - With $(x,y,z)$:

- Intuitively speaking, only vertices are sent down to the graphics pipeline so we need to interpolate the texture coordinates

- This is done by a scanline in screen space 

- It is had its own issues such as **perspective foreshortening (why ?)**

- How do we correctly figure out the texture coordinates ? 

  - Interpolate along the scanline

  - Perform perspective division **after** interpolation
